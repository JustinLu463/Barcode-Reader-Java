Barcode Reader Java:
- This repository contains a Java application for reading and decoding barcodes.

Contents:
- .classpath: Eclipse classpath configuration file.
- .project: Eclipse project configuration file.
- barcode1.png: Sample barcode image.
- barcode1Mutation.png: Mutated sample barcode image.
- barcodeBadCheck.png: Sample barcode image with a bad checksum.
- barcodeUpsidedown.png: Upside-down sample barcode image.
- src/: Source code directory containing the implementation of the barcode reader.
- bin/: Compiled Java classes.

Prerequisites:
To run this project, you'll need the following:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- An IDE that supports Java, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

Setup:
 - Clone the repository
 - Open the project in your IDE:
   - If using Eclipse, you can import the project as an existing project.
   - If using IntelliJ IDEA, you can open the project directory directly.
  
Sample Barcodes:
- barcode1.png
- barcode1Mutation.png
- barcodeBadCheck.png
- barcodeUpsidedown.png

How It Works:
- The barcode reader application processes images of barcodes and decodes the information contained within them. The main steps include:
  - Image Loading: Loading the barcode image using the DUImage class.
  - Image Processing: Processing the image to identify the barcode pattern.
  - Decoding: Decoding the barcode pattern to retrieve the encoded information.
